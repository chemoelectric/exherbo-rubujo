SUMMARY="Bazaar is a simple distributed version control system"
DESCRIPTION="
Bazaar is a simple decentralized revision control system. Decentralized revision
control systems give users the ability to branch remote repositories to a local
context. Users can commit to local branches without requiring special permission
from the branches that they branched from.
If you have a choice, use dev-scm/git instead.
