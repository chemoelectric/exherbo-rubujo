DESCRIPTION="
Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The database is
a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value.
Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary data and
character string can be used as a key and a value. There is neither concept of
data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or
